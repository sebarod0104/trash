## Branches

Contentstack provides **Branches** to allow you to create multiple copies of your stack content. Every stack has a *main branch* by ~~default~~. To create a new branch, you can fork a branch off of the main branch.
When you create a branch for the first time, the main branch becomes your _source branch_. For all subsequent branches you create, you need to specify a source branch from which it will __inherit data__.

> **Note**: The *Branches* feature is only available in the [new Contentstack interface](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/new-contentstack).
